Parts list based on Mercy0 comment (https://github.com/frenchguycooking/doughsheeter/issues/2#issuecomment-536134070) and my own inspection of the video.

v3-side-arm
v3-side-arm-mirror
2x double-ended-driving-gear
2x bobin-gear-v1 
2x big-intermediate-gear-and-washer
10x rack-1
8x teflon glides with screw hole
2x side-panel-hollow as template for side panels
Wood for side panels
Screws of various sizes
Wood for platform of sheeter
6x bearings
6x washers

Looks like he changed how he drives the dough sheeter some shots show one method and other shots show a different method.

One method is to have only one side have a hex end that is printed for driving (double ended driving gear) and the other side doesn't stick out much past the bearing and side arm, not quite sure what piece he uses for the other side

The second method I see is one side has the double-ended-driving-gear and the other side has the 6mm-heaxagonal-gear and most likely 6mm-hexagonal-insert attached to a cut off 6mm allen wrench.

I think implementation wise it would be easiest to start with two double-ended-driving-gear and switch to a different method later if needed.

20231005 Update:
Starting working with friend to get parts printed. Updated bobin-gear fusion file to allow for a 2 inch diameter rolling pin. The current file has a 1.95 inch diameter. We will wait to print the bobin gear until the rolling pin arrive and I check the diameter with calipers.

Thinking about using a cutting board type sheet for the sheeter instead of wood. Either Polypropylene or Polyethylene. These are two current contenders:
